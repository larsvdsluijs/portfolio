          <p class="about-text">
            I am a passionate software developer currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. 
            My journey in tech began with a strong interest in creating user-friendly applications, and I've developed a particular focus on full-stack development, 
            with a slight preference for frontend work. I love crafting intuitive interfaces and solving complex problems through clean, maintainable code.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            Beyond my studies, I actively explore new technologies and frameworks, always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. 
            I believe in continuous learning and the power of collaboration within the tech community. 
            Whether it's building responsive web applications or diving into the latest frontend frameworks, 
            I'm constantly pushing myself to create better, more accessible digital experiences.
